We re gonna use multiple differents librairies, bur I might take a look at api from deap evol and pillow 

-> Have to choose with deap and evol

-> Possibility to use other forms like ellipses, BÃ©sier curbes, polygons 

-> Cross-Over -> We should think about it carefully

Selection Function -> Elitism is great 

-> eaMuCommaLambda remove the parents from the solution then do selection

Use multiprocessing from python (create a pool) and we can register this pool in a map function

-> Build evolution : generate the offspring with mutation
